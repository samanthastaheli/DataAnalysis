## Future Work

* Use the name dataset to make charts of different names.
* Find what the most popular names are. 
* Have a dataset that contains all seasons of the Friends dialoge.
* Analyze how popular/books sold before and after Tic Tok.   
* Analyze book sales before and after thei movie released.
